    <div class="case-study-heading"><h2>Research Phase</h2></div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>According to Statista, there are 1.7 million Australians using online dating apps at present and revenue in this sector is expected to grow from $35 million in 2020, to $51 million by 2024. 

        Tinder wants to not only retain but grow their market share but remain the number one used dating app online. This means increasing user retention.
        
        User interviews were conducted as part of the research phase.

    <div class="case-study-heading"><h2>Definition Phase</h2></div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>A group brainstorm using the I like, I wish, What if method to find solutions to our user insight’s. </p></div>

    <div>
        <img src="images/tinder7.svg" class="case-size" alt="htmlcss icon">
    </div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>Using a feature prioritisation matrix, ideas and features were placed in a matrix to find high impact and low complexity solutions to the user’s problems with dating apps.</p></div>

    <div>
        <img src="images/tinder8.svg" class="case-size" alt="htmlcss icon">
    </div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>We observed that Tinder isn’t achieving the goal of having its users find meaningful connections online, and many people feel online dating is very superficial. This is causing our users to get frustrated and confused as they get ghosted, ultimately moving to competitor apps.

        Therefore, we need to enhance our users’ experience by allowing users’ friends to take an active role in the matchmaking process. This in turn will allow users to make more meaningful connections and solve the issue of users being ghosted online. 
        </p></div>

    <div>
        <img src="images/tinder9.svg" class="case-size" alt="htmlcss icon">
    </div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>A competitive analysis has been conducted amongst major competitors such as Bumble, Hinge and Plenty of Fish. We compared Tinder, including the matchmaker feature we had ideated to solve our user insight with other dating app services in the market.

        Upon performing the analysis, it was discovered that no other dating app service allows users to collaborate with friends. If Tinder Matchmaker is successful, it will be the only dating app service that provides a blind dating service. 
        
        No other app allows users to verify their identity. However, Plenty of Fish combats catfishing by using “filter detecting” AI. It was identified in the feature prioritisation that verifying user IDs would have a high level of impact, and was very doable as there are many existing services out there that allow users to verify their details in minutes.
        
        Tinder’s strengths are its number of users. As the most downloaded dating app in the world, Tinder’s competitive advantage is its customer base. Upon conducting the SWOT analysis, a gap in the market was uncovered, and an opportunity for Tinder to accommodate the needs of its users.
        
        As Tinder’s users are the competitive advantage, it is crucial for Tinder to accommodate the needs of its existing users, so that they don’t get fed up, delete our app and move to a competitor’s service. The user persona was then formed.

    <div class="case-study-heading"><h2>Ideation Phase</h2></div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>Three key features were picked to add to Tinder’s current dating app. Here are the user flows and how they fit into Tinder’s current dating app. In the wireframes and user flow, it was imperative to stay true to the iconic UI elements of Tinder and the mechanics of the swipe features. 

        In this user flow, the user is frustrated with their matches and has an existing Tinder account. The user sends a link to their friend to help in the matchmaking process. The onboarding process for matchmakers is illustrated on the right. 
        
        Once the matchmakers have onboarded, they can start swiping, as per normally done on Tinder. The matchmaker can go to their messages to chat with candidates to set up dates, or unmatch them.
        
        Regarding the matchmakers, creating the wireframes and mapping the user flow helped identify potential issues on where this feature will physically be within the app, as well as how matchmakers (who potentially have Tinder accounts) can switch between their own personal account, and the matchmaker one.

    </div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>Results from our testing were very positive. We found that our features were indeed quite intuitive.

        Through AB testing, we found that users preferred the option to manually input their friend’s contact numbers to invite as Matchmakers.

    <div class="case-study-heading"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>

    <div class="text-box-large"><p>KEY LEARNINGS
        Daily Standups
        Completing daily stand ups helped us keep on track on what we were doing
        
        Understanding the user flow of the existing app
        It was key for this task that because we were adding extra features to a dating app that already exists, it was very important to thoroughly study the app and understand the user flow already in place. 
        
        FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
        - improve the elements on the ‘chats to friends’ screen to incorporate the bios of all the matches
        - creating the ability to vote and poll candidates amongst a group chat of friends
        - ‘Anti-filter’ AI technology to combat ‘cat-fishing’
